A lightweight, responsive Todo app built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It demonstrates **state management**, **dynamic rendering**, and **user interaction**, making it perfect for beginners and intermediate developers.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create tasks with a title and details.  
- **View Tasks**: Tasks are displayed dynamically in responsive cards.

## How It Works

1. **State Management**  
   - Uses `useState` to track tasks, title, and details.  

2. **Adding Tasks**  
   - Fill the form and click **Create**. The task is added and inputs are cleared.  

3. **Deleting Tasks**  
   - Each task has a **Delete** button. Clicking it removes the task and updates the UI.  

4. **Dynamic Rendering**  
   - The `task` array is mapped to render each task as a card.  
   - Each task has a unique `key` for proper React rendering.
